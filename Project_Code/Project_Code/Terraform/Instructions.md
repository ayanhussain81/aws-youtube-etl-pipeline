Note:

- In this Terraform script, QuickSight creation was not included because of a Managed Identity conflict. Therefore, you need to create QuickSight manually.

- In this Terraform script, we did not specify the service-level execution steps.
So you need to perform the required configurations manually inside each service, based on what needs to be executed in every stage.

- Also, watch the video to learn how to add the AWS Wrangler layer to the Lambda function. Once the Lambda function is created using Terraform, the AWS Wrangler layer must be added.

### Prerequisites:

Install AWS CLI and configure your credentials using aws configure. Install Terraform on your system.

### AWS CLI Installation Link

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html


### Configure AWS CLI on Your System

## Execute this command on Terminal to setup AWS CLI on the local system
```aws configure```


1. Enter your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
2. Specify the region where your IAM user has access.


This sets up local system to interact with AWS services using the CLI and necessary for the execution using terraform.

##### Terraform Commands
Step 1: Initialize Terraform

```terraform init```


This command sets up your working directory for Terraform. It downloads the required providers and prepares the environment for deployment.


Step 2: Preview Terraform Plan

```terraform plan```


This command shows all the changes Terraform will make to infrastructure. You can review the changes safely before actually applying them.

Step 3: Validate Terraform Configuration


This command checks all Terraform files for syntax errors. It ensures that configuration is correct before applying it.

Step 4: Apply Terraform Changes

```terraform apply```


This command applies your Terraform configuration to create or update resources in AWS. You will be prompted to confirm before Terraform makes any changes.


Step 5: Apply Terraform Changes Automatically

```terraform apply --auto-approve```


This command applies all Terraform changes without asking for confirmation. It is useful for automated deployments or pipelines.


Step 6: Destroy Terraform Resources

```terraform destroy```

This command removes all resources that were created and managed by Terraform. Use this command carefully to avoid accidentally deleting important resources.
